Dog Days was a Spring 2021 vgDev game that I created and led. It is a 3D social simulation game, inspired by games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. You play as two dogs, Kali and Kobe. Quests await for our two doggo friends around the neighborhood! It's a great game for when you want to relax to some peaceful music and just walk around like you don't have a care in the world.
