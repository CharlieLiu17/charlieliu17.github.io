## Description

Dog Days was a Spring 2021 vgDev game that I created and led. It is a 3D social simulation game, inspired by games like Animal Crossing and Stardew Valley. You play as two dogs, Kali and Kobe. Quests await for our two doggo friends around the neighborhood! It's a great game for when you want to relax to some peaceful music and just walk around like you don't have a care in the world.

## The How

We made this game with the Unity game engine. I've made games before in Unity, but never in 3D and never on this scale. We had team members dedicated to working on creating original music, fabricating 3D models (I'm super proud of the white picket fence!), writing game systems (items, quests, movement). Over 10 weeks, we worked on one week sprints, with weekly meetings and demos. There was so much to be done, and I'm very proud of our team for managing to create a fleshed-out 3D social simulation game within 10 weeks during a rough, Covid-era semester.
