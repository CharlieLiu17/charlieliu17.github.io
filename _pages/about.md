I'm Charles 'Charlie' Liu, a 3rd-year computer science student at Georgia Tech, with concentrations in **human-computer interaction** and **computer networking**. I've always loved software development and I've grown to love every corner of this industry.

## :weight_lifting_man: What I'm about

I love designing all sorts of games and applications, but one thing must stay consistent - **designing with the user as the number one priority**. 

As an athlete myself, I know personally a struggle that almost all athletes have - being able to train effectively when they train alone. That's why I created [Techniq](https://github.com/CharlieLiu17/Techniq).

As a longtime League of Legends player, I created [a program](https://github.com/CharlieLiu17/league-projects) to prepare players with important information before a game, to maximize players' potentials at every step.

When I discovered the important role that tax sales and foreclosures play in the housing industry, I created the ultimate [parser](https://github.com/CharlieLiu17/tax-sale-foreclosure-parser) that allowed for easy viewing and organization for potential buyers.

## âš¡ Fun fact: 

I recently discovered my love for gardening!
